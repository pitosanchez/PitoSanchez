👋 Hi, I’m @PitoSanchez
👀 I’m interested in transforming kidney health equity, community-powered storytelling, and building tech that serves real people.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript, TypeScript, and how to scale grassroots advocacy with digital tools.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on community health projects, patient education platforms, or anything that uplifts Black and Brown voices in medicine.
📫 How to reach me: robertpsanchez.com 
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I co-founded a theater program while incarcerated that went on to inspire a major film SING SING — proof that art, healing, and justice can intersect anywhere.
